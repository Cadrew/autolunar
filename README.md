# Autolunar

Autolunar is a cryptographic pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) based on cellular automata.

### How does it work?

TBD

### Build

```
go build
```

### TODOs

- Make output tests to check if this is cryptographic
- Find good seeds
- Read seeds from CSV
- Adjust default settings
- Optimize execution
- Write docs & readme
